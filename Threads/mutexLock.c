/*  

pthread_join() â€” Wait for a thread to end

Notes:

    When pthread_join() returns successfully, the target thread has been detached.
    Multiple threads cannot use pthread_join() to wait for the same target thread to end. 
    If a thread issues pthread_join() for a target thread after another thread has successfully 
    issued pthread_join() for the same target thread, the second pthread_join() will be unsuccessful.
    If the thread calling pthread_join() is canceled, the target thread is not detached.
