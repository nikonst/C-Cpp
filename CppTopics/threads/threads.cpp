/*
The following routine is used to create a POSIX thread âˆ’

#include <pthread.h>
pthread_create (thread, attr, start_routine, arg) 

pthread_create creates a new thread and makes it executable. 
This routine can be called any number of times from anywhere within the code

----------

If main() finishes before the threads it has created, and exits with pthread_exit(),
the other threads will continue to execute. Otherwise, they will be automatically
terminated when main() finishes.
